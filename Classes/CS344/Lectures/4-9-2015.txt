GRAPHS
G = (V, E) [ Vertex set, Edge set ]

Representation
	adjacency list
		[a] -> [e] -> [g]
		...
	adjacency matrix (row, column)
		  a b c
		a 0 1 0
		b 1 0 1
		c 0 1 0
	directed: arrow indicates direction
	undirected: both ways of direction

G has n vertices and m edges
Space complexity adj list = 0(n + m)
Space complexity adj matrix = 0(n^2) because you use display vertices vs vertices

Sink: a vertex with no out-going edges
	0(n) if searching for sink using adj list
	0(n^2) if searching for sink using adj matrix

Connectivity: Two vertices are disconnected if there is no path connecting them

Strongly connected: there is a path connecting any pair of vertices

Connected component: a subgraph that is strongly connected
